                <section>
                    <p>The morning sun dances across Lake Superior as fishing guide Tom Nakamura prepares what he calls "the most peaceful meal on earth"—fresh trout cooked on cedar planks over an open fire, seasoned with herbs gathered from the shoreline.
                    <br>
                    <blockquote>
                        "Indigenous peoples have cooked fish this way for thousands of years," Nakamura explains, soaking untreated cedar planks in lake water. "The wood steams from below while the fire kisses from above. The fish stays incredibly moist."
                    </blockquote>
                    This technique transforms a simple catch into something transcendent, filling the air with aromatic smoke while creating a natural, non-stick cooking surface that infuses subtle woodsy flavors.

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            2 untreated cedar planks, soaked 2+ hours
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            2 whole trout, cleaned (12-14 inches each)

                            Fresh wild herbs: dill, chives, or wild garlic

                            3 tablespoons olive oil
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Coarse sea salt and black pepper
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Stable fire with good coals

                <section>
                    <h4>The Gathered Method:</h4>

                    <p>While the planks soak, walk the shoreline collecting herbs. "Look for the bright green shoots of wild chives near rocky areas," advises Nakamura. "Crush a leaf between your fingers—the oniony scent tells you it's right."
                    Build your fire and let it burn down to glowing coals with minimal flame. You want consistent, medium heat that won't char the cedar.
                    Pat fish completely dry and brush inside and out with olive oil. 
                    <br>
                    Season generously with salt and pepper. Stuff the cavity with lemon slices and fresh herbs—this is where the magic happens.
                    Place fish on the soaked planks and set them on your fire grate, about 8 inches above the coals. The planks will begin to steam and smoke—this is exactly what you want.
                    <blockquote>
                        "This is meditation time," says Nakamura's daughter Amy, who learned the technique during childhood camping trips. "You tend the fire, watch the sunset, and just breathe. The fish tells you when it's ready."
                    </blockquote>
                    Cook 15-20 minutes without flipping. The fish is done when it flakes easily at the thickest part. The cedar creates a natural serving platter—no cleanup required.
                    Serve immediately with gathered herbs sprinkled on top and lemon wedges on the side. The combination of wood smoke, fresh herbs, and perfectly cooked fish creates a meal that tastes like pure wilderness.

                    <h4>The Gathered Method:</h4>
                    <p>Begin by preparing the chicken—slice the fillets into strips, then mix with oil and all the marinade spices, letting it rest for a while. Next, heat oil in a frying pan or on a cooking plate and fry the chicken until it develops a beautiful golden surface before setting it aside.
                    <br><br>
                    In the same pan, add butter and fry the shallot until golden, then build the flavor by adding garlic, tomato paste, bruschetta mix, and sun-dried tomatoes. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Create the creamy base by adding the cream, bouillon cube, and spinach, then grate in some parmesan cheese.
                    <br><br>
                    When the cream has thickened slightly, combine the pasta along with 1 dl pasta water (if using fresh pasta, you can use hot cooking water instead). Once the pasta has absorbed into the sauce, add the final touches by grating plenty of parmesan over the pasta and seasoning with salt, pepper, and optionally a little chili.
                    <br><br>
                    Now just serve it to someone you want to impress or someone you care about very much!</p>

                    <h4>The Gathered Method:</h4>
                    <p>Start by cooking the mushrooms in a dry pan until they release all their water. Then add butter, shallots, and garlic, frying until the onions soften. Build the base by adding chopped parsley, mushroom bouillon, salt, and pepper—fry for a while before pouring in the heavy cream.
                    <br><br>
                    When the sauce is almost ready, combine it with the cooked pasta and a little pasta water. Taste and adjust the final seasoning with salt and pepper, then sprinkle over grated parmesan.
                    <br><br>
                    Eat and enjoy! Bon appétit!</p>

                        <li>Butter for frying</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><b>Instructions:</b> Whisk together the eggs, milk, sugar, cardamom, and salt in a bowl. Add the flour and baking powder, then whisk until smooth.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Tip:</b> This batter is perfect to prepare at home! Pour it into a thermos or a bottle, and when you're out in the forest just shake it up and pour straight into the pan for that real outdoor vibe.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><b>Mascarpone Cream</b></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>250g mascarpone</li>
                        <li>2 dl heavy cream</li>
                        <li>1 tbsp powdered sugar</li>
                        <li>1 tsp ground cardamom seeds</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><b>Instructions:</b> Whip the cream and set aside, then whip the mascarpone with powdered sugar and cardamom. Finally, fold in the whipped cream.</p>

                    <p><b>Almond Paste</b></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>200 grams toasted almonds</li>
                        <li>1 dl powdered sugar</li>
                        <li>1 pinch salt</li>
                        <li>1 tsp ground cardamom seeds</li>
                        <li>1-2 dl water</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><b>Instructions:</b> Blend the almonds to your preferred consistency, then add the remaining ingredients. Vary the amount of water depending on how thick you prefer it.</p>

                    <h4>The Gathered Method:</h4>
                    <p>Begin by making the pancakes, heat a pan with a good piece of butter and pour in small rounds of batter. Cook gently until bubbles appear on top, then flip and cook the other side until golden. Serve topped with mascarpone cream, almond paste, and toasted almonds. 
                    <br>
                    Now eat, enjoy, and thank us later!
                    <br><br>
                    P.S. The mascarpone cream and almond paste make enough for several portions, so you can serve many people. Just increase the eggs and cream for the toast to serve more people.</p>
